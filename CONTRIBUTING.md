## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and GraphQL
- Familiarity with Hasura and n8n (helpful but not required)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hasura-chat-app.git
   cd hasura-chat-app
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Set up your development environment**
   - Update configuration in \`lib/constants.ts\`
   - Ensure you have access to the required services (Hasura, n8n, etc.)

4. **Start the development server**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

## üìã Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper interfaces and types in \`lib/types.ts\`
- Avoid \`any\` types - use proper typing
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper prop typing with interfaces

### Code Organization
- Keep components small and focused
- Use the established folder structure:
  - \`components/\` - Reusable UI components
  - \`lib/\` - Utilities, services, and business logic
  - \`app/\` - Next.js app router pages and layouts

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the established design system
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Use semantic HTML elements

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
- Test all user flows (login, chat creation, messaging)
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid inputs)
- Check accessibility with screen readers

### Code Quality
- Run the linter before committing: \`npm run lint\`
- Format code with Prettier: \`npm run format\`
- Ensure TypeScript compilation: \`npm run type-check\`

## üìù Commit Guidelines
